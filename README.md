# Introduction to bioinformatics

### Description

This repository contains training material for an introductory lecture to bioinformatics. The focus is placed on practical aspects, such as how to use selected bioinformatics workflows and tools to analyse RNA-, Ribo-seq, and proteomics data.

We will be using a subset of the data from [D.A. Rothenberg et al. A Proteomics Approach to Profiling the Temporal Translational Response to Stress and Growth. iScience. 2018; 9:367-381](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004218301949?via%3Dihub).

### Requirements

#### Hardware/software requirements

You need a functional laptop with *e.g.* [eduroam](https://cat.eduroam.org) connection and WireGuard installed, see [Setting up WireGuard](https://github.com/dieterich-lab/bioinformatics-lectures/wiki/Preparation-Workshop). All the core software that will be used in this practical is already available in the HPC cluster of the Dieterich Lab.

#### General requirements

Before the practical, consult these resources if needed:

* [BASH shell basics](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice) or [command line tutorials](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/command-line-for-beginners)
* [Python basics](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation) - Sections 1 to 5
* [R Basics](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation) - Sections 1 to 4
* How to use Linux editors *e.g.* [vim](https://www.openvim.com)

Consult the Wiki under [Further Reading](https://github.com/dieterich-lab/bioinformatics-lectures/wiki/Further-Reading) for additional references.

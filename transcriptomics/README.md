## Transcriptomics

Transcriptomics is the analysis of the transcriptome, the collection of all RNAs that are present in a cell, tissue or organ at a given time. Studying the transcriptome provides insights into how genes regulate their expression *e.g.* to respond to environmental stimuli.

This part of the practical will cover the basics of an end-to-end gene-level [RNA-seq differential expression workflow](RNAseq/README.md). We will also get a glimpse of computational methods for [alternative or differential splicing analysis](Splicing/README.md), as well as [Ribo-seq data analysis and translatomics](Riboseq/README.md).

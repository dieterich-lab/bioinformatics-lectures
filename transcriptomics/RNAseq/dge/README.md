# Differential expression analysis

## Learning objectives:

* To perform differential gene expression (DGE) analysis using the expression data generated in the first part of the practical.
* Understand essential statistical concepts used to model gene expression.

## Prerequisites

For running the analysis, the participiants need to do the following:

* Go to [https://r.internal](https://r.internal) and login using your LDAP credentials 

<!--* Set the working directory to: ```setwd("/beegfs/pub/hbigs_course_2022/part1_RNAseq/dge/")```
* Add the libPath: ```.libPaths <- .libPaths( c( .libPaths(), "/biosw/hbigs_course_2022_eg/1.0.0/rlibs") )```
* Check if the added libPath is present in the list: ```.libPaths()```
* Open *dge_analysis.R* script.-->

From here on we continue with the analysis workflow.
